#+TITLE: custom-css.el - Load custom CSS snippets
#+AUTHOR: Florian Rommel
#+LANGUAGE: en

Style the GTK widgets (menu bar, scroll bars, tool bar, context menus)
in your Emacs with custom CSS snippets.  Works with GTK only.

This is experimental and hacky.  Expect breaking changes.


* Installation

Clone the repository and put the path in your load path.
Then, require ~custom-css~ in your init file:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/custom-css")
(require 'custom-css)
#+END_SRC

Or use use-package:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package custom-css
  :load-path "path/to/custom-css")
#+END_SRC

The package needs a native C module to be compiled and loaded into
Emacs.  The package will try to build the module when loading.
This needs GTK, a C compiler, make, and pkg-config to be installed.
Currently, this has only been tested on GNU/Linux.


* Usage

Use ~custom-css-load~ to load a custom CSS snippet.
Every CSS snippet is associated with a symbol to identify it.
Use it to unload it via ~custom-css-unload~.

You can inspect Emacs's GTK widgets and experiment with CSS via:
~M-x~ and ~(x-gtk-debug)~


** Customizing the Scroll-Bar Appearance

Customizing the scroll bar is a bit tricky because the width is not
only determined by CSS.  The minor mode ~custom-css-scroll-bar-mode~
simplifies modifying the scroll-bar appearance.

Customize ~on-demand-scroll-bar-custom-css~ and
~on-demand-scroll-bar-custom-css-width~.

Optionally, use ~on-demand-scroll-bar-mode~ to show the scroll bar only
when needed:

* Alternatives

You can write custom CSS into ~$HOME/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css~.
Use ~window#Emacs~ in all your CSS selectors to target Emacs only.
